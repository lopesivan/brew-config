How to start
There are 6 steps to start:

1 - Clone reposity:


git clone https://github.com/ezored/ezored.git
2 - Enter on cloned folder:


cd ezored
3 - Install python requirements:


pip install -r requirements.txt
4 - Setup conan tool:


python make.py conan setup
5 - Setup glue code tool:


python make.py gluecode setup
6 - Now all commands are available. Run the following command to list all
  targets that you can build:


python make.py target
Example: If you are on Linux, you can build the linux target, if on macOS you
can run macos target and if on Windows you can run windows.


python make.py target linux prepare
python make.py target linux build
python make.py target linux package
python make.py target linux dist generate
Obs:

You can download the project as a ZIP file too:
https://github.com/ezored/ezored/archive/main.zip.

After run this commands above, a folder called "dist" will be created with
compiled binaries of applications. The rule is the same for other targets.

The execution order is important. You need prepare files and dependencies,
build, package and finally distribute.

Package verbs will copy files to a non versioned folder called "dist" in root
path.

You don't need run prepare verb everytime, only run if you never run it before
or if you change configuration (example is version number), added dependencies,
changed dependency version or other things that need call prepare to
generate target files and rebuilt your dependencies.

Conan profiles are required to specify basic environment profile things to
build targets, but some settings are changed while build, like arch and
build_type.

Check requirements for each target. Example: iOS target require that you have a
macOS system.
